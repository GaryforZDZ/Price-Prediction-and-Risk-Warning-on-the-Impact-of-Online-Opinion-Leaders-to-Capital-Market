# Price-Prediction-and-Risk-Warning-on-the-Impact-of-Online-Opinion-Leaders-to-Capital-Market
Summary  
This project studies the impact of online opinion leaders on the capital market in the era of big data, and takes Liu Qiangdong and Musk as examples to make relevant predictions and warnings.
An end-to-end workflow from data collection → sentiment scoring → feature engineering → price-impact modeling → alerts. We continuously monitor leader-related texts and events, convert them into sentiment and event-intensity signals, align with market data, and train models to forecast price direction and risk level.
